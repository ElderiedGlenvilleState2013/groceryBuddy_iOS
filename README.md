Replaced the .prepare method with a .pluck and cleaned the code by removing unnecessary .select method in the userDataBase file to only select the logged in users account from the database. Need to work on the conditional statements if user enters the wrong user info.

This a grocery buddy mobile app, helps the user make a list of items needed and comes with a calculator the costs of the entire purchase. What this app should do is it registers and signs in a user (all saving and selected from sqlite3 database), caculator already works, add items to the the items table works but still working on the user having his own specific list of groceries where he can view/edit and delete them as the user wishes.
